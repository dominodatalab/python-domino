:latest-version: 1.2.4
:python-domino-repo: https://github.com/dominodatalab/python-domino

This library provides bindings for the Domino APIs.  It ships with the Domino Standard Environment (DSE).
// In older versions it ships with the DAD.

See this documentation for details about the APIs:

* https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/api_guide/f35c19/api-guide/[Latest public Domino APIs]
* https://dominodatalab.github.io/api-docs/[Legacy APIs]

The latest released version of `python-domino` is `{latest-version}`.

== Version compatibility matrix

The `python-domino` library is compatible with different versions of Domino:

[cols=",^"]
|===
| Domino Versions | python-domino

| 3.6.x or lower
| {python-domino-repo}/archive/0.3.5.zip[0.3.5]

| 4.1.0 or higher
| {python-domino-repo}/archive/1.0.0.zip[1.0.0] or higher

| 5.3.0 or higher
| {python-domino-repo}/archive/1.2.1.zip[1.2.0] or Higher

| 5.5.0 or higher
| {python-domino-repo}/archive/1.2.2.zip[1.2.2] or Higher
|===

== Development

The current `python-domino` is based on Python 3.9, which is therefore recommended for development.
`Pipenv` is also recommended to manage the dependencies.

To use the Python binding in a Domino workbook session, include `dominodatalab` in your project's
ifdef::env-github[]
https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/9c4f82[requirements.txt file].
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
link:9c4f82[requirements.txt file].
endif::[]
This makes the Python binding available for each new workbook session (or batch run) started within the project.

To install dependencies from `setup.py` for development:

[source,shell]
----
pipenv install -e ".[dev]"
----

Use the same process for Airflow and data:

[source,shell]
----
pipenv install -e ".[data]" ".[airflow]"
----

== Set up the connection

You can set up the connection by creating a new instance of `Domino`:

[source,python]
----
_class_ Domino(project, api_key=None, host=None, domino_token_file=None, auth_token=None)
----

.Parameters

* `project`: A project identifier (in the form of owner_user_name/projectname).

* `api_proxy`: (Optional) Location of the Domino API reverse proxy as `host:port`.
+
If set, this proxy is used to intercept any Domino API requests and insert an authentication token.
_This is the preferred method of authentication_.
Alternatively, set the `DOMINO_API_PROXY` environment variable.
In Domino 5.4.0 or later, this variable is set inside a Domino run container.
+
NOTE: This mechanism does not work when connecting to an HTTPS endpoint; it is meant to be used inside Domino runs.

* `api_key`: (Optional) An API key to authenticate with.
+
See
ifdef::env-github[]
https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/api_guide/d982cc/get-api-key/[Get API Key].
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
link:d982cc[Get API Key].
endif::[]
If not provided, the library expects to find one in the `DOMINO_USER_API_KEY` environment variable.

* `host`: (Optional) A host URL.
+
If not provided, the library expects to find one in the `DOMINO_API_HOST` environment variable.

* `domino_token_file`: (Optional) Path to the Domino token file containing auth token.
+
If not provided, the library expects to find one in the `DOMINO_TOKEN_FILE` environment variable.

* `auth_token`: (Optional) Authentication token.

=== Authentication

Domino looks for the authentication method in the following order and uses the first one it finds:

. `api_proxy`
. `auth_token`
. `domino_token_file`
. `api_key`
. `DOMINO_API_PROXY`
. `DOMINO_TOKEN_FILE`
. `DOMINO_USER_API_KEY`

The API proxy is the preferred method of authentication.
See
ifdef::env-github[]
https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/api_guide/ddf8eb[Use the API Proxy to Authenticate Calls to the Domino API].
endif::[]
ifndef::env-github[]
link:ddf8eb[Use the API Proxy to Authenticate Calls to the Domino API].
endif::[]

=== Additional environment variables

* `DOMINO_LOG_LEVEL`
+
The default log level is `INFO`.
You can change the log level by setting `DOMINO_LOG_LEVEL`, for example to `DEBUG`.

* `DOMINO_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE`
+
For testing purposes and issues with SSL certificates, set `DOMINO_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE` to `false`.
Be sure to unset this variable when not in use.

== Methods

=== Datasets

A Domino dataset is a collection of files that are available in user executions as a filesystem directory.
A dataset always reflects the most recent version of the data.
You can modify the contents of a dataset through the Domino UI or through workload executions.

See https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/ba5bad/manage-data-in-domino-datasets/[Domino Datasets] for more details, and {python-domino-repo}/blob/release-{latest-version}/examples/example_dataset.py[`example_dataset.py`^] for example code.

== Example

[source,python]
----
from domino import Domino

# By and large your commands will run against a single project,
# so you must specify the full project name
domino = Domino("chris/canon")

# List all runs in the project, most-recently queued first
all_runs = domino.runs_list()['data']

latest_100_runs = all_runs[0:100]

print(latest_100_runs)

# all runs have a commitId (the snapshot of the project when the
# run starts) and, if the run completed, an "outputCommitId"
# (the snapshot of the project after the run completed)
most_recent_run = all_runs[0]

commitId = most_recent_run['outputCommitId']

# list all the files in the output commit ID -- only showing the
# entries under the results directory.  If not provided, will
# list all files in the project.  Or you can say path=“/“ to
# list all files
files = domino.files_list(commitId, path='results/')['data']

for file in files:
print file['path'], '->', file['url']

print(files)

# Get the content (i.e. blob) for the file you're interested in.
# blobs_get_v2 returns a connection rather than the content, because
# the content can get quite large and it's up to you how you want
# to handle it
print(domino.blobs_get_v2(files[0]['path'], commitId, domino.project_id).read())

# Start a run of file main.py using the latest copy of that file
domino.runs_start(["main.py", "arg1", "arg2"])

# Start a "direct" command
domino.runs_start(["echo 'Hello, World!'"], isDirect=True)

# Start a run of a specific commit
domino.runs_start(["main.py"], commitId="aabbccddee")
----

== Airflow

The `python-domino` client comes bundled with an https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/operators.html[Operator^] for use with https://airflow.apache.org/[Apache Airflow^] as an extra.

When installing the client from PyPI, add the `airflow` flag to extras:

[source,shell]
----
pip install "dominodatalab[airflow]"
----

Similarly, when installing the client from GitHub, use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
pip install -e git+{python-domino-repo}.git@1.0.6#egg="dominodatalab[airflow]"
----

See also {python-domino-repo}/blob/release-{latest-version}/examples/example_airflow_dag.py[example_airflow_dag.py] for example code.

=== DominoOperator

[source,python]
----
from domino.airflow import DominoOperator
----

Allows a user to schedule Domino executions via Airflow.
Follows the same function signature as `domino.runs_start` with two extra arguments:

[cols=2*]
|===
| `startup_delay: Optional[int] = 10`
| Add a startup delay to your job, useful if you want to delay execution until after other work finishes.
| `include_setup_log: Optional[bool] = True`
| Determine whether to publish the setup log of the job as the log prefix before `stdout`.
|===

=== DominoSparkOperator

[source,python]
----
from domino.airflow import DominoSparkOperator
----

Allows a user to schedule Domino executions via the v4 API, which supports `onDemandSparkClusters`.
Follows the same function signature as `domino.job_start`, with the addition of `startup_delay` from above.

== Manual installation

Because `python-domino` ships with the DSE, normally you do not need to install it.
This section provides instructions for installing it in another environment or updating it to a newer version.

Starting from version `1.0.6`, `python-domino` is available on PyPI as `dominodatalab`:

[source,shell]
----
pip install dominodatalab
----

If you are adding install instructions for `python-domino` to your https://support.dominodatalab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000392643-Compute-Environment-Management[Domino Environment^] Dockerfile Instructions field, you must add `RUN` to the beginning:

[source,shell]
----
RUN pip install dominodatalab
----

To install a specific version of the library from PyPI, such as `1.0.6`:

[source,shell]
----
pip install dominodatalab==1.0.6
----

To install a specific version of the library from GitHub, such as `1.0.6`:

[source,shell]
----
pip install {python-domino-repo}/archive/1.0.6.zip
----
