This library provides bindings for the Domino APIs.  It ships with the Domino Standard Environment (DSE).

See this documentation for details about the APIs:

-   [Latest public Domino
    APIs](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/api_guide/8c929e/domino-public-apis/)

-   [Legacy APIs](https://dominodatalab.github.io/api-docs/)

The latest released version of `python-domino` is `1.3.0`.

# Development

The current `python-domino` is based on Python 3.9, which is therefore recommended for development. `Pipenv` is also recommended to manage the dependencies.

To use the Python binding in a Domino workbook session, include `dominodatalab` in your project's requirements.txt file.
This makes the Python binding available for each new workbook session (or batch run) started within the project.

To install dependencies from `setup.py` for development:

    pipenv install -e ".[dev]"

Use the same process for Airflow and data:

    pipenv install -e ".[data]" ".[airflow]"

# Set up the connection

You can set up the connection by creating a new instance of `Domino`:

    _class_ Domino(project, api_key=None, host=None, domino_token_file=None, auth_token=None)

-   *project:* A project identifier (in the form of ownerusername/projectname).
    
-   *api_proxy:* (Optional) Location of the Domino API reverse proxy as host:port.

    If set, this proxy is used to intercept any Domino API requests and insert an authentication token.
    _This is the preferred method of authentication_. 
    Alternatively, set the `DOMINO_API_PROXY` environment variable.
    In Domino 5.4.0 or later, this variable is set inside a Domino run container.

    NOTE: This mechanism does not work when connecting to an HTTPS endpoint; it is meant to be used inside Domino runs.

-   *api_key:* (Optional) An API key to authenticate with. 

    If not provided, the library expects to find one in the `DOMINO_USER_API_KEY` environment variable.
    If you are using the Python package in code that is already running in Domino, the `DOMINO_API_USER_KEY` variable is set automatically to be the key for the user who started the run.

-   *host:* (Optional) A host URL. 

    If not provided, the library expects to find one in the `DOMINO_API_HOST` environment variable.

-   *domino_token_file:* (Optional) Path to the Domino token file
    containing the auth token. 

    If not provided, the library expects to find one in the `DOMINO_TOKEN_FILE` environment variable.
    If you are using Python package in code that is already running in Domino, the `DOMINO_TOKEN_FILE` is set automatically to be the token file for the user who started the run.

-   *auth_token:* (Optional) Authentication token.

## Authentication

Domino looks for the authentication method in the following order and uses the first one it finds:

1. `api_proxy`
2. `auth_token`
3. `domino_token_file`
4. `api_key`
5. `DOMINO_API_PROXY`
6. `DOMINO_TOKEN_FILE`
7. `DOMINO_USER_API_KEY`

The API proxy is the preferred method of authentication.
See 
[Use the API Proxy to Authenticate Calls to the Domino API](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/40b91f/domino-api/).

## Additional environment variables

- `DOMINO_LOG_LEVEL`
  
    The default log level is `INFO`.
    You can change the log level by setting `DOMINO_LOG_LEVEL`, for example to `DEBUG`.

- `DOMINO_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE`
  
    For testing purposes and issues with SSL certificates, set `DOMINO_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE` to `false`. 
    Be sure to unset this variable when not in use.

# Methods

## Projects

See
[`example_projects_usage.py`](https://github.com/dominodatalab/python-domino/blob/release-1.3.0/examples/example_projects_usage.py)
for example code.

## Project tags

Project tags are an easy way to add freeform metadata to a project. Tags
help colleagues and consumers organize and find the Domino projects that
interest them. Tags can be used to describe the subject explored by a
project, the packages and libraries it uses, or the source of the data
within.

## Datasets

A Domino dataset is a collection of files that are available in user
executions as a filesystem directory. A dataset always reflects the most
recent version of the data. You can modify the contents of a dataset
through the Domino UI or through workload executions.

See [Domino
Datasets](https://docs.dominodatalab.com/en/latest/user_guide/0a8d11/datasets-overview/)
for more details, and
[`example_dataset.py`](https://github.com/dominodatalab/python-domino/blob/release-1.3.0/examples/example_dataset.py)
for example code.

### datasets_list(project_id=None)

    delete. NOTE: Datasets are first marked for deletion, then deleted
    after a grace period (15 minutes, configurable). A Domino admin may
    also need to complete this process before the name can be reused.

### datasets_upload_files(dataset_id, local_path_to_file_or_directory, file_upload_setting, max_workers, target_chunk_size, target_relative_path)

Uploads a file or entire directory to a dataset.

# Airflow

The `python-domino` client comes bundled with an
[Operator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/operators.html)
for use with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) as an extra.

When installing the client from PyPI, add the `airflow` flag to extras:

    pip install "dominodatalab[airflow]"

Similarly, when installing the client from GitHub, use the following
command:

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/dominodatalab/python-domino.git@1.0.6#egg="dominodatalab[airflow]"

See also
[example_airflow_dag.py](https://github.com/dominodatalab/python-domino/blob/release-1.2.1/examples/example_airflow_dag.py)
for example code.

## DominoOperator

    from domino.airflow import DominoOperator

Allows a user to schedule Domino executions via Airflow. Follows the
same function signature as `domino.runs_start` with two extra arguments:

- `startup_delay: Optional[int] = 10` | Add a startup delay to your job, useful if you want to delay execution until after other work finishes.
- `include_setup_log: Optional[bool] = True` | Determine whether or not to publish the setup log of the job as the log prefix before `stdout`.

## DominoSparkOperator

    from domino.airflow import DominoSparkOperator

Allows a user to schedule Domino executions via the v4 API, which
supports `onDemandSparkClusters`. Follows the same function signature as
`domino.job_start`, with the addition of `startup_delay` from above.

# Example

    from domino import Domino

    # By and large your commands will run against a single project,
    # so you must specify the full project name
    domino = Domino("chris/canon")

    # List all runs in the project, most-recently queued first
    all_runs = domino.runs_list()['data']

    latest_100_runs = all_runs[0:100]

    print(latest_100_runs)

    # all runs have a commitId (the snapshot of the project when the
    # run starts) and, if the run completed, an "outputCommitId"
    # (the snapshot of the project after the run completed)
    most_recent_run = all_runs[0]

    commitId = most_recent_run['outputCommitId']

    # list all the files in the output commit ID -- only showing the
    # entries under the results directory.  If not provided, will
    # list all files in the project.  Or you can say path=“/“ to
    # list all files
    files = domino.files_list(commitId, path='results/')['data']

    for file in files:
    print file['path'], '->', file['url']

    print(files)

    # Get the content (i.e. blob) for the file you're interested in.
    # blobs_get returns a connection rather than the content, because
    # the content can get quite large and it's up to you how you want
    # to handle it
    print(domino.blobs_get(files[0]['key']).read())

    # Start a run of file main.py using the latest copy of that file
    domino.runs_start(["main.py", "arg1", "arg2"])

    # Start a "direct" command
    domino.runs_start(["echo 'Hello, World!'"], isDirect=True)

    # Start a run of a specific commit
    domino.runs_start(["main.py"], commitId="aabbccddee")

# Manual installation

Because `python-domino` ships with the DSE, normally you do not need to install it.  
This section provides instructions for installing it in another environment or updating it to a newer version.

Starting from version `1.0.6`, `python-domino` is available on PyPI as `dominodatalab`:

    pip install dominodatalab

If you are adding install instructions for `python-domino` to your [Domino Environment](https://support.dominodatalab.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000392643-Compute-Environment-Management) Dockerfile Instructions field, you must add `RUN` to the beginning:

    RUN pip install dominodatalab

To install a specific version of the library from PyPI, such as `1.0.6`:

    pip install dominodatalab==1.0.6

To install a specific version of the library from GitHub, such as
`1.0.6`:

    pip install https://github.com/dominodatalab/python-domino/archive/1.0.6.zip
